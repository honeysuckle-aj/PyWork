## gif2png

require: PIL

It can change gif-files in `gifs` to png-files which are contatenated into a column. To use it, you need to create `gifs,pngs,out` three folders and put your target gif-files into `gifs`. 

Make sure you are in the `gif2png` folder. Then run it and you'll get splited png-files in `pngs` and contatenated png-files in `out`
